# Currency Exchange SPA

A two-page single-page application (SPA) for viewing and managing currency
exchange rates.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **React** â€” building interactive UI
- **Redux Toolkit & React Redux** â€” global state management
- **Redux Persist** â€” state persistence between sessions
- **React Router DOM** â€” routing between pages
- **Axios** â€” HTTP requests to external API
- **React Select** â€” enhanced dropdown for selecting currencies

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Detects user's base currency based on location
- Shows real-time exchange rates relative to the selected base currency
- Allows filtering rates by currency name
- Allows switching the base currency via searchable dropdown

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

This project helped me strengthen practical knowledge of:

- React fundamentals: components, props, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`,
  `useSelector`, `useDispatch`)
- Redux Toolkit: slices, async thunks, selectors
- Middleware and data persistence with `redux-persist`
- API integration using `axios`
- Routing logic with `react-router-dom`
- Managing controlled inputs and debounced filters
